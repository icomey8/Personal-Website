# Personal-Website

This is my personal website that I made to act as a hub for the personal projects that I've been working on.  This is currently a work in progress, so projects and other changes will continue to be added.

This was made with HTML and CSS.  The map on the homepage with the flashing dots represent where I've lived, and was made for aesthetic purposes through MapLibre JS, a TypeScript library that allows you to add custom interactive maps into a browser page.
